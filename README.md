## **This package is named as â€œApollo" in order to double sallute the great Apollo Program.**

*Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, "Because it is there."
Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.*			------President John F. Kennedy

This package will be the foundation on which our platform would be based on, it will be very difficult, however, **DO NOT LET THE FAILURE DEFINE US, LET FAILURE TEACH US !**

version_num_data_month, we are now at version 0.1, if want to update version, please talk with the group.
> example: *version_0.1_02_Nov	*

------------
### 23_Dec_2018

add the crf_suite turorail in the HMM_CRF directory

------------
### 17_Dec_2018

revise the viterbi algorithm, named 'Viterbi_2nd.py', which provides more clear comments

------------
### 16_Dec_2018

add the viterbi algorithm in HMM_CRF directory

------------

### 15_Nov_2018
**GOOD NEWS !**
add the CRF model to the Apollo directory
the test_folder is used for testing
add the encoder_decoder_attention to the Apollo directory

------------
### 09_Nov_2018
add the model which could be trained by CUDA parallel computing, however, we need to fix the problem as below:
> install CUDA 9.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, because Pytorch doesn't support CUDA 10.0 nowadays and CUDA 9.2 doesn't support Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS

### 07_Nov_2018
We have a strong weapon today --- our own CBOW model which could be used for training Word2Vec on the specific corpus. 
Notice: If you don't have a specific corpus, please use pre-trained model from google.
This frameword has limited function now, which could only trained the embedding matrix, it doesn't provide other useful interface, such as consine similarity, display the matrix, etc. These functions will be added soon.
Feel free to contact with me if you find any bug.

1. add an open source framwork, recommended by my supervisor Dr. Andreas Vlachos
GitHub: https://github.com/jiesutd/NCRFpp
2. Add BERT from Google, GOOD news ! Google released its Chinese model.
